# Knob Hook

[See Homepage](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2773661)

This is a special hook designed to hold flat objects with a hole.  It was designed initially for a cutting board with a straight hole cut through.
The goal of the hook was to have it sit flush with the hole, close to the wall, and not to show any countersinked screws.
